Products tab
=====================

Shipping cost rules can apply to categories and/or products. The :guilabel:`Products` tab allows you to configure the necessary assignments. Without assignment of categories and/or products, the shipping cost rule will apply to the entire product catalogue.

Clicking on this button will open the assignment window and display the two lists - :guilabel:`All Categories` and :guilabel:`Assigned Categories`.

Select a category from the drop-down list if you only want to display products from this category. You can also filter and sort products by product number, title and/or EAN. Drag and drop the products into the right-hand list to assign them to the shipping cost rule. Hold down the Ctrl key to select multiple products.
