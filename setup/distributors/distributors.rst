Distributors
===========

OXID eShop allows you to manage distributors. You can assign products to the distributors to document their sources. Products can be filtered and displayed by the distributor ID in the Admin panel. Distributors are not used in the shop’s front end since shop owners are certainly not interested in making this information public.
